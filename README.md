# Hyleria Network

The code powering all of Hyleria (when it was a thing) is contained within this single repository. From backend utlility scripts to user-facing games; it's here.

#### What the directories here do:

 - `common` A collection of utilities & tools that may be useful to any Hyleria oriented application
 - `config` Backend configuration files - either these are just examples with filler values, or local dev ones.
 - `plugin` Plugins that run Hyleria - whether it be a proxy sided, game engine, or our core systems
 - `script` A set of bash scripts that save some time on backend tasks
