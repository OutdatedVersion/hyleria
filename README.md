# Hyleria Network

The code powering all of Hyleria (when it was a thing) is contained within this single repository. From backend utlility scripts to user-facing games; it's here.

#### What the directories here do:

 - `bungee-plugin` Hook into our (currently single) BungeeCord proxy
 - `spigot-plugin` The mostly user oriented side of Hyleria. Contains our games, and in-game stuff.
 - `script` A set of bash scripts that save some time on backend tasks
 - `config` Backend configuration files - either these are just examples with filler values, or local dev ones.
